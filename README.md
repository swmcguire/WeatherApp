## Description

WeatherApp Dashboard

As someone who lives in Minnesota, I like to know what the temperatures is going to be for the day.  It's also nice to know the temperature for the rest of the week.

On top of that since I travel pretty regularly for work it is nice to know what the temperature will be for work events.

This application will allow me to look at the current temperature in different locations around the world all by using one simple search.

This project was very helpful in breaking down the API calls.

## Installation

No installation necessary, simply navigate to the correct web site and begin by entering a city name in the search bar.  Or if you'd like, use the pre-selected buttons to get the weather data you desire.

## Usage

No usage instructions necessary, the webiste was designed with simplicy and ease in mind.  Begin by entering a city in the search box or click a pre-selected city and get the weather results.
